# PassWizard
An easy-to-use python program using an advaned API that checks whether a password is strong or not by finding out if it has been ever exposed on the internet.  
Simply run the main file using python command and give the passwords you want to check thier saftey as arguments.  
This program doesn't expose the password on the internet as it sends the hash to the API and not the password.
